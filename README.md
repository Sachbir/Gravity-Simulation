# Gravity-Simulation

This is just intended as a short, fun project to simulate masses orbiting one another, but as an additional effort, I intend to use this as an exploration of other ideas. I'd like to implement a better system to measure performance (via UPS), and I could use this to improve on performance issues I have faced in previous projects.
