TODO:

- calculate possible collisions on the fly
    - multithreading so it doesn't lag the simulation
- skip frames instead of lagging
- show the path while the sim is running
    - instead of recalculating it, just pop the first element and add one
        to the end
    - currently the path is drawn, and then drifts away in space as the
        objects are recentered. So, that'd need to be fixed
